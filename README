This is a collection of TextExpander snippets I've written or modified.

==

googl-shortener.applescript  
    Create goo.gl shortened URL - The "Internet Productivity" bundle that
    TextExpander provides includes several script snippets for shortening URLs.
    I wanted to use Google's shortner, so I wrote this script, which is
    adapted from Smile's bit.ly shortener.

googl-shortener.py
    Create goo.gl shortened URL - I am not really a fan of AppleScript at
    all, so this version of the goo.gl shortener is a python script which 
    can be called from TextExpander as a shell script.  
    Depends on https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/

bacon-ipsum.py
    Get two paragraphs of bacon ipsum text.  Based on the AppleScript
    version here: https://gist.github.com/2220524

convert-to-uppercase.py
    Converts the current clipboard to all caps
